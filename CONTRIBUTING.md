## Contributing

This project is open source and licensed under the [Apache Public License (version 2)](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).  Please consider forking this project to improve, enhance or fix issues. If you feel like the community will benefit from your fork, please open a pull request.

To protect the interests of the contributors, Appcelerator, customers and end users we require contributors to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. Our CLA is simple and straightforward - it requires that the contributions you make to any Appcelerator open source project are properly licensed and that you have the legal authority to make those changes. This helps us significantly reduce future legal risk for everyone involved. It is easy, helps everyone, takes only a few minutes, and only needs to be completed once.

[You can digitally sign the CLA](http://bit.ly/app_cla) online. Please indicate your email address in your first pull request so that we can make sure that will locate your CLA.  Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one for subsequent submissions.
